Problem Statement

You are a data analyst at a retail company. Your manager has asked you to
create a stacked bar chart to visualize the quarterly sales of three different
products (Product A, Product B, and Product C) over the year 2023. The
data should be generated within the code. Your task is to write a Python
script that generates this data and then creates a stacked bar chart to display
it.
The chart should have:
‣ The x-axis representing the quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).
‣ The y-axis representing the sales amount.
‣ Different colors for each product.
‣ A legend to distinguish between the products.
